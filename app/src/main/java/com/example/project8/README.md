<span style="font-size: smaller;"><strong> Description </strong> </span>
In our efforts to complete Project 07 we implemented an interactive Ui (User Interface) that allows the user to add notes utilizing Firebase's Realtime Database.

This app allows for a user to:
- Search for a movie
- See the stats (rating, ranking, runtime, etc)
- Share a link
- Visit the IMDB page via link

To begin we integrated an API call to the IMDB page in order to request information on a Movie. If the request
was valid, we parsed the data from the JSON file and displayed the values in an XML file. Through this process we 
allowed the user to share this data or click the link to take them to the IMDB page.
<br>
<br>
When taken to the main page, you are able to enter in a movie title, upon hitting search the app takes you to a page that 
holds the information, the poster, and ability to share the movie. Additionally, if you feel you cana lso submit feedback by pressing
the button up in the ribbon where you will be taken to gmail or any other messaging platform you have installed on your emulator.
<br>
<br>
In the case that you submit an invalid movie title, the contents will not populate and you will be told that the IMDB page does not support that movie.




## Functionality
'*' indicates tested in GIF  
The following **required** functionality is completed:

**Demonstrated**
<br>
**START**
* [SEARCH] [Parent Trap] -> [No photo for this movie] -> [All stats came up] -> [back to main page]

UI Challenges:
- Connecting the link as clickable and passing the data in from the JSON file and handling correctly
- UI was relatively simple so not many errors followed

Backend Challenges:
- Calling the API point
- Data Binding stopped working when we attempted the recycler view
- Working with the format through indexing was more of a learning curve but easy once we got it down
